python -m pytest tests/test_scraper.py

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=ctms
```

### Code Formatting
```bash
# Format code with black
black ctms/

# Check code style
flake8 ctms/

# Type checking
mypy ctms/
```

### Database Development
```bash
# Initialize database
python -c "from ctms.database.database import Database; import asyncio; asyncio.run(Database().initialize())"

# Reset database
rm ctms/data/threat_intelligence.db
```

## 📊 Adding New Sources

3. Add appropriate rate limiting and error handling
4. Test with the source

### Paste Sites
1. Add to paste sites configuration
2. Implement content extraction
3. Add threat keyword detection
4. Test content parsing

### GitHub Monitoring
1. Add new search queries
2. Implement repository analysis
3. Add exploit detection logic
4. Test with GitHub API
