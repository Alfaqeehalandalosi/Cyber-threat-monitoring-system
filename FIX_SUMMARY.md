# Cyber Threat Monitoring System - Fix Summary

## üö® Problem Description

You were experiencing a persistent API error (500 Internal Server Error) when trying to run a scraping cycle for your "Cyber-threat-monitoring-system" project. The specific error was:

```
AttributeError: 'ThreatIntelligenceScraper' object has no attribute 'run_full_cycle'
```

This error occurred when the system tried to call a method on the `ThreatIntelligenceScraper` object that didn't exist.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

After analyzing your entire codebase, I identified the following issues:

### 1. Missing Method in ThreatIntelligenceScraper
The `ThreatIntelligenceScraper` class was missing the `run_full_cycle()` method that some code was trying to call.

### 2. Missing Method in ThreatAnalyzer
The `ThreatAnalyzer` class was missing the `analyze_latest_threats()` method that was referenced in the error.

### 3. Incorrect Method Usage
Some code was trying to call `run_full_cycle()` directly on the scraper instead of using the proper `ScrapingOrchestrator.run_scraping_cycle()` method.

### 4. Missing Background Function
The `_background_run_scrape()` function mentioned in your error description was missing from the codebase.

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Backward Compatibility Methods

**File: `ctms/scraping/tor_scraper.py`**
- Added `run_full_cycle()` method to `ThreatIntelligenceScraper` class
- This method provides backward compatibility by creating a `ScrapingOrchestrator` and calling the correct method

```python
async def run_full_cycle(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Run a full scraping cycle for all enabled sources.
    This method provides backward compatibility for older code.
    """
    logger.info("üîÑ Starting full scraping cycle (backward compatibility)")
    
    try:
        # Create orchestrator and run cycle
        orchestrator = ScrapingOrchestrator()
        await orchestrator.initialize()
        
        try:
            results = await orchestrator.run_scraping_cycle()
            logger.info("‚úÖ Full scraping cycle completed")
            return results
        finally:
            await orchestrator.close()
            
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"‚ùå Full scraping cycle failed: {e}")
        raise
```

### 2. Added Missing Analysis Method

**File: `ctms/nlp/threat_analyzer.py`**
- Added `analyze_latest_threats()` method to `ThreatAnalyzer` class
- This method analyzes the latest scraped content for threats

```python
async def analyze_latest_threats(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Analyze the latest scraped content for threats.
    This method provides backward compatibility for older code.
    """
    logger.info("üîç Analyzing latest threats (backward compatibility)")
    
    try:
        db = await get_database()
        
        # Get latest unanalyzed content
        latest_content = await db.scraped_content.find(
            {"analysis_id": {"$exists": False}},
            sort=[("scraped_at", -1)],
            limit=50
        ).to_list(length=50)
        
        if not latest_content:
            return {
                "status": "no_content",
                "message": "No new content to analyze",
                "analyzed_count": 0
            }
        
        # Convert to ScrapedContent objects and analyze
        content_objects = [ScrapedContent(**doc) for doc in latest_content]
        analyses = await self.batch_analyze(content_objects)
        
        return {
            "status": "completed",
            "analyzed_count": len(analyses),
            "analyses": [analysis.dict() for analysis in analyses],
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
        }
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"‚ùå Latest threats analysis failed: {e}")
        raise
```

### 3. Added Background Scraping Function

**File: `ctms/api/main.py`**
- Added `_background_run_scrape()` function for backward compatibility
- This function provides the interface that was mentioned in your error

```python
async def _background_run_scrape(job_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Background scraping function for backward compatibility.
    This function provides the interface that was mentioned in the error.
    """
    logger.info(f"üîÑ Starting background scraping job: {job_id}")
    
    try:
        # Create scraper and run full cycle
        from ctms.scraping.tor_scraper import create_scraper
        from ctms.nlp.threat_analyzer import ThreatAnalyzer
        
        scraper = await create_scraper()
        
        try:
            # Run full scraping cycle
            scraping_results = await scraper.run_full_cycle()
            
            # Analyze latest threats
            analyzer = ThreatAnalyzer()
            analysis_results = await analyzer.analyze_latest_threats()
            
            results = {
                "job_id": job_id,
                "status": "completed",
                "scraping_results": scraping_results,
                "analysis_results": analysis_results,
                "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
            }
            
            logger.info(f"‚úÖ Background scraping job {job_id} completed successfully")
            return results
            
        finally:
            await scraper.close()
            
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"‚ùå Background scraping job {job_id} failed: {e}")
        return {
            "job_id": job_id,
            "status": "failed",
            "error": str(e),
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
        }
```

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging

- Improved error handling throughout the codebase
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

## üöÄ How to Use the Fixed System

### Quick Installation

1. **Run the installation script:**
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

2. **Start the services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Start the API server:**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   python -m ctms.api.main
   ```

4. **Start the dashboard (in a new terminal):**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   streamlit run ctms/dashboard/main_dashboard.py
   ```

### Test the Fixes

Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
python test_fix.py
```

This will test:
- ‚úÖ Scraper methods (including `run_full_cycle`)
- ‚úÖ Analyzer methods (including `analyze_latest_threats`)
- ‚úÖ Background scraping function
- ‚úÖ API endpoints
- ‚úÖ Database connection

### API Usage

The system now supports both the old and new method calls:

**New Method (Recommended):**
```python
from ctms.scraping.tor_scraper import ScrapingOrchestrator

orchestrator = ScrapingOrchestrator()
await orchestrator.initialize()
results = await orchestrator.run_scraping_cycle()
await orchestrator.close()
```

**Old Method (Backward Compatible):**
```python
from ctms.scraping.tor_scraper import create_scraper

scraper = await create_scraper()
results = await scraper.run_full_cycle()  # This now works!
await scraper.close()
```

### API Endpoints

- **Health Check:** `GET /health`
- **System Stats:** `GET /stats`
- **Run Scraping:** `POST /api/v1/scraping/run` (FIXED)
